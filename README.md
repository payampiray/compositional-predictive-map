## Overview

The model is implemented in both Python and MATLAB.  
- The **Python code** is used for generating Figures 1–5.  
- The **MATLAB code** is used for generating Figures 6–9.  

The MATLAB implementation builds on the code by Dordek et al. 2016, available at [https://github.com/derdikman/Dordek-et-al.-Matlab-code](https://github.com/derdikman/Dordek-et-al.-Matlab-code). No specific toolbox needed for running the matlab code.
